== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the Required Plugins to use ShopBuild? =
ShopBuild requires **Elementor Page Builder and WooCommerce**.

= Why Elementor Editor fails to load or not working? =
It’s due to your server PHP settings. Increase your server PHP memory limit from the wp-config.php file or php.ini file. If you don’t have an idea about it. Please contact your hosting provider and ask to increase PHP's – 

* **memory_limit = 512M**

* **max_execution_time = 300**

= Why ShopBuild Showing Error: “you must call function “the_content” in current template to make Elementor works on this page”? =
This is a common issue in WordPress with Elementor. In most cases, this issue arises because of the permalinks structure in WordPress. To resolve this error, reset the permalinks structure.

How to reset permalinks and fix permalink problems:

From the admin dashboard,

**Go to :** Settings > Permalinks
**Chose** the **Structure** of your preference under common settings
**Save** changes.
